# .story/ - Incidents & Experiments

This directory contains **real-world incident reports** and **architecture validation experiments** for Delta Engine.

## What's Here?

### incidents/
Post-mortem reports of real problems encountered during development or production:
- Root cause analysis
- Timeline of events
- Solutions implemented
- Prevention measures

### experiments/
Records of architecture validation experiments (POC-first methodology):
- Assumptions tested
- POC results
- Decision rationale
- Learnings captured

## Why This Exists?

**Problem**: Standard documentation (specs, guides) don't capture:
- How things go wrong in practice
- Why certain approaches failed
- Lessons learned from real incidents

**Solution**: Dedicated space for "war stories" and validation records.

## When to Add Content?

### Add Incident Report When:
- ‚úÖ Real bug/issue with non-obvious root cause
- ‚úÖ Problem required significant investigation
- ‚úÖ Solution worth documenting for future
- ‚úÖ Prevention measures actionable

### Add Experiment When:
- ‚úÖ Validated major architectural approach with POCs
- ‚úÖ Multiple options tested with concrete results
- ‚úÖ Learnings applicable to future decisions

### Don't Add:
- ‚ùå Simple bugs (use git commit messages)
- ‚ùå Obvious fixes (use code comments)
- ‚ùå Architecture decisions (use `docs/decisions/` - ADRs)

## Naming Convention

### Incidents
Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-short-description.md`

Example: `2025-10-09-journal-corruption.md`

### Experiments
Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-short-description.md`

Example: `2025-10-01-poc-validation.md`
