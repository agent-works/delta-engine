# v1.10 Test Plan: Frontierless Workspace

**Version**: 1.10.0
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-17
**Related Documents**:
- Design: `docs/architecture/complete-design-v1.1-v1.10.md`
- Implementation: Completed in src/

---

## Purpose

This test plan validates the v1.10 "Frontierless Workspace" implementation against the design document's requirements. It serves as an independent quality gatekeeper, ensuring all acceptance criteria are met before shipping.

**Key Principle**: Tests are based on design promises, not implementation details.

---

## Test Strategy

### Testing Approach

1. **Unit Tests**: Critical invariants and safety mechanisms
2. **Integration Tests**: Feature behavior validation (E2E approach)
3. **E2E Tests**: Complete user journeys

**Priority System**:
- **P0 (Must Have)**: Blocking - must pass for release
- **P1 (Should Have)**: Important - should pass for quality release
- **P2 (Nice to Have)**: Optional - can defer to next release

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Explicit-Only Resumption (REQ-3.2)

**Priority**: P0

**User Story**:
As a user in a Frontierless Workspace, I need `delta continue` to require explicit `--run-id`, so that I can safely resume specific runs without ambiguity.

**Test File**: `tests/integration/v1.10/explicit-continue-requirement.test.ts`

**Scenarios**:
1. ✅ `delta continue` without `--run-id` → Error (exit code 1)
2. ✅ Error message mentions `--run-id` requirement
3. ✅ `delta continue --run-id <valid-id>` → Success
4. ✅ Run is properly resumed (not recreated)
5. ✅ Journal is appended (evidence of resume)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Command rejects without `--run-id`
- [x] Error message is clear and actionable
- [x] Explicit `--run-id` allows continuation
- [x] Resume behavior is correct

**Result**: ✅ **PASS** - All scenarios validated

---

### Scenario 2: Duplicate Run ID Protection (REQ-3.4)

**Priority**: P0

**User Story**:
As a user providing client-generated run IDs, I need the engine to reject duplicates, so that I don't accidentally overwrite existing run data.

**Test File**: `tests/integration/v1.10/duplicate-run-id.test.ts`

**Scenarios**:
1. ✅ First run with client ID succeeds
2. ✅ Duplicate ID attempt rejected (exit code 1)
3. ✅ Error message quality (mentions "already exists", run ID, suggests action)
4. ✅ Original run data completely untouched (byte-level verification)
5. ✅ No partial state created before failure (fail-fast)
6. ✅ Different ID works correctly

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Engine rejects duplicate client-provided run ID with clear error
- [x] Error occurs BEFORE any files are created (fail-fast)
- [x] Original run data remains untouched
- [x] Error message is actionable (suggests using different ID)
- [x] Exit code is non-zero (script-friendly)

**Bugs Found**: 2 (both fixed during Phase 1.2)
1. Resume-first logic bypassed duplicate ID check
2. Explicit `--run-id` triggered auto-resume instead of creating new run

**Result**: ✅ **PASS** - All scenarios validated

---

### Scenario 3: Janitor Mechanism (REQ-3.5)

**Priority**: P0

**User Story**:
As a user, I need the engine to safely clean up orphaned RUNNING processes, so that I can recover from crashes or network issues without data corruption.

**Test File**: `tests/unit/janitor.test.ts`

**Scenarios** (20 tests total):

**Quick Return (4 tests)**:
1. ✅ Skip cleanup for COMPLETED status
2. ✅ Skip cleanup for FAILED status
3. ✅ Skip cleanup for INTERRUPTED status
4. ✅ Skip cleanup for WAITING_FOR_INPUT status

**PID Liveness Check (2 tests)**:
5. ✅ Detect dead process and allow cleanup
6. ✅ Reject cleanup if current process (still alive)

**Process Name Verification - PID Reuse Protection (2 tests)**:
7. ✅ Detect PID reuse by different process type
8. ✅ Fail cleanup if process name matches (still running)

**Cross-Host Detection (3 tests)**:
9. ✅ Refuse cleanup for different hostname without --force
10. ✅ Allow cleanup with --force for cross-host scenario
11. ✅ Use current hostname for same-host detection

**Edge Cases (3 tests)**:
12. ✅ Handle permission denied (EPERM) as process alive
13. ✅ Handle ESRCH (no such process) as dead process
14. ✅ Handle process name check failure gracefully

**applyJanitorCleanup Function (3 tests)**:
15. ✅ Transition RUNNING to INTERRUPTED
16. ✅ Preserve all other metadata fields
17. ✅ Work for non-RUNNING status (idempotent)

**Integration Workflows (3 tests)**:
18. ✅ Correctly identify and clean orphaned run
19. ✅ Refuse cleanup for active run
20. ✅ Detect PID reuse and clean up safely

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Quick return for non-RUNNING status
- [x] PID liveness check (kill -0)
- [x] Process name verification (PID reuse protection)
- [x] Cross-host detection with --force override
- [x] Safe RUNNING → INTERRUPTED transition
- [x] Edge case handling (EPERM, ESRCH)

**Result**: ✅ **PASS** - All 20 tests passing

---

### Scenario 4: LATEST File Removal (REQ-3.6)

**Priority**: P0

**User Story**:
As a user of v1.10 Frontierless Workspace, I need the engine to NOT use LATEST files, so that multiple agents can run concurrently without race conditions.

**Test File**: `tests/integration/v1.10/latest-file-removal.test.ts`

**Scenarios**:
1. ✅ First run does NOT create LATEST file
2. ✅ Workspace structure contains only explicit run directories
3. ✅ Second concurrent run also does NOT create LATEST
4. ✅ Both runs coexist without conflict
5. ✅ Manual LATEST file (migration scenario) is ignored
6. ✅ Third run with LATEST present still creates new run
7. ✅ All three runs are independent

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] `delta run` does NOT create LATEST file
- [x] `delta continue` does NOT use or reference LATEST file
- [x] Workspace only contains explicit run directories
- [x] No LATEST pointer or symlink exists
- [x] Manual LATEST file (from migration) is ignored

**Result**: ✅ **PASS** - All scenarios validated

---

### Scenario 5: Concurrent Multi-Agent Execution (REQ-4.1)

**Priority**: P1

**User Story**:
As a user, I want to run multiple agents concurrently in the same workspace, so that I can build complex multi-agent orchestration patterns.

**Test File**: `tests/e2e/04-concurrent-agents.test.ts` (pre-existing)

**Scenarios**:
1. ✅ Multiple agents run concurrently without conflicts
2. ✅ Each run has independent run directory (`.delta/{run_id}/`)
3. ✅ Journal histories remain independent
4. ✅ No LATEST file race conditions
5. ✅ Workspace data plane is shared correctly
6. ✅ All runs complete successfully

**Result**: ✅ **PASS** (pre-existing test)

---

### Scenario 6: Output Format Separation (REQ-4.2)

**Priority**: P1

**User Story**:
As a user, I need structured output formats (`--format json|raw`) separate from logs, so that I can compose Delta with Unix tools.

**Test File**: `tests/e2e/output-formats-and-io.test.ts` (pre-existing)

**Scenarios**:
1. ✅ `--format text` provides human-readable output
2. ✅ `--format json` provides parseable JSON
3. ✅ `--format raw` provides Unix-pipe-friendly output
4. ✅ Logs go to stderr, structured output to stdout
5. ✅ I/O separation is maintained across all formats

**Result**: ✅ **PASS** (pre-existing test)

## Appendix

### Test Methodology

This test plan follows the improved quality-gatekeeper methodology:

1. **Test Quality Evaluation First** (not just execution results)
2. **Meta-Level Auditing** (evaluate if tests are trustworthy)
3. **Genuine Confidence** (not rubber stamps)
4. **Bug Discovery** (tests must catch real issues)

### Test Quality Criteria

**Grade A Tests** (exemplary):
- Use real system interactions (not excessive mocking)
- E2E tests use actual CLI (not library imports)
- Strong, specific assertions (not vague checks)
- Would catch implementation bugs (not just "no error")
- Cover edge cases and error paths

**Grade B Tests** (adequate):
- Functional but could be more comprehensive
- Some assertions could be stronger
- Missing some edge cases

**Grade C Tests** (weak):
- Rubber stamp risk (could pass with broken code)
- Weak assertions ("no error" instead of "correct behavior")
- Missing critical scenarios

**v1.10.1 Status**: All new tests are Grade A.
