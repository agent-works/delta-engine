# Delta Engine Architecture Specification v1.9: Unified Agent Structure and Compositional Configuration

**Version**: 1.9.0
**Date**: October 13, 2025
**Status**: Final Specification
**Author**: Delta Engine Chief Architect

---

## 1. Overview and Motivation

Delta Engine's core mission is to provide "engineering effective and simple" tools to accelerate AI Agent prototyping. Through the evolution from v1.1 to v1.8, the legacy `config.yaml` file from the v1.0 era has proven inadequate for its increasingly diverse responsibilities. The ambiguous naming and monolithic structure have become apparent limitations. Additionally, as Agent complexity has grown, the need for configuration modularity and reusability has become urgent.

Version 1.9 aims to achieve clarity, standardization, and modularity in the Agent configuration system through a comprehensive refactoring. Core achievements of this refactoring include:

1. **Clear Naming Convention**: Introducing `agent.yaml` to replace `config.yaml`, achieving ultimate intuitiveness.
2. **Compositional Configuration**: Introducing the `imports` mechanism to implement a "single-file first + explicit composition" flexible architecture.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Decoupling lifecycle hooks into an independent `hooks.yaml` file.

## 2. Core Philosophy and Design Principles

This refactoring strictly adheres to Delta Engine's core philosophy:

### 2.1 Engineering Effective and Simple

Architecture design must serve engineering practice. We choose a "single-file first" pattern, ensuring that for 80% of simple scenarios, developers can quickly start and iterate, avoiding the cognitive overhead of over-modularization.

### 2.2 Explicit over Implicit

For composing core capabilities, we adopt explicit `imports` declarations rather than implicit "auto-discovery." This ensures the completeness and transparency of `agent.yaml` as the configuration entry point, aligning with our commitment to expert users.

### 2.3 Composition Defines Intelligence

Through the `imports` mechanism, we extend the "composition" philosophy to the configuration file level, allowing developers to package, share, and reuse common capability sets, laying the foundation for a future ecosystem.

### 2.4 Progressive Disclosure

For advanced features (such as `context.yaml` and `hooks.yaml`), we adopt a "convention over configuration" pattern. They are optional and only appear when users need them, lowering the barrier for beginners.

## 3. Detailed Specification: Agent Project Structure

v1.9 defines a new, standardized Agent project structure.

### 3.1 Standard Project Structure

```
/path/to/MyAgent/
├── agent.yaml          # [Required] Core definition: metadata, LLM config, tools, imports
├── system_prompt.md    # [Required] Core instructions
├── context.yaml        # [Required] Cognitive strategy (v1.6+, mandatory in v1.9.1+)

# --- Optional advanced configuration ---
├── hooks.yaml          # [Optional] Lifecycle hooks (v1.9+)

# --- Resources and modules ---
├── tools/              # (Optional) Private tool scripts directory
└── modules/            # (Optional) Importable configuration modules directory
    └── file_ops.yaml
```

### 3.2 Core File Definitions and Responsibilities

We establish clear responsibility boundaries and loading strategies:

| File | Responsibility | Contents | Loading Strategy | Status |
|------|---------------|----------|------------------|---------|
| **`agent.yaml`** | Agent main definition and capability entry point | `metadata`, `llm_config`, `tools`, `imports` | **Explicit loading** (configuration entry point) | **Required** |
| **`context.yaml`** | Cognitive and perception strategy | `sources` list (v1.6) | **Explicit loading** (v1.9.1+) | **Required** (v1.9.1+) |
| `hooks.yaml` | Lifecycle reaction patterns | `lifecycle_hooks` definition | **Convention loading** (auto-applied if exists) | Optional |

### 3.2.1 `agent.yaml`: Core and Entry Point

`agent.yaml` replaces `config.yaml` as the Agent's core definition file and sole configuration entry point. It embodies the "single-file + explicit composition" architecture strategy.

### 3.2.2 `hooks.yaml`: Separation of Concerns

Moving `lifecycle_hooks` from the core definition into an independent `hooks.yaml` file. The engine automatically detects and loads this file at startup if it exists.

## 4. Schema Specification

### 4.1 `agent.yaml` Schema (v1.9)

```yaml
# === 1. Metadata ===
name: MyAgent
description: A brief description of the agent.

# === 2. Core Configuration / Thinking ===
llm_config:
  model_name: "gpt-4o"
  temperature: 0.2
  # ... other LLM parameters

# === 3. Capability Composition (v1.9 new) ===
# Optional: Import tool definitions from external YAML files.
imports:
  - ./modules/file_ops.yaml
  - ./modules/web_search.yaml
  # Future extension support for remote imports, e.g.:
  # - npm:@delta/common-tools/v1.0.0/base.yaml

# === 4. Capability Definition / Tools ===
# Optional: Directly define agent tools here.
# Follows v1.7 exec:/shell: syntax sugar specification.
tools:
  - name: list_files
    description: "List files in the current directory."
    exec: "ls -F ${directory}"

  - name: summarize_report
    description: "Summarize the final report."
    exec: "python3 ${AGENT_HOME}/tools/summarize.py ${file_path}"
```

### 4.2 `hooks.yaml` Schema (v1.9)

```yaml
# Define Agent's reaction patterns to engine lifecycle events.
# Root node of this file is the lifecycle_hooks object.

# Execute before LLM call
pre_llm_req:
  command: ["python3", "${AGENT_HOME}/tools/context_optimizer.py"]

# Execute before tool execution
pre_tool_exec:
  command: ["${AGENT_HOME}/tools/validate_args.sh"]

# Execute at run end (regardless of success or failure)
on_run_end:
  command: ["delta-sessions", "cleanup"]
```

## 5. Composition Mechanism: `imports` Detailed Explanation

The `imports` mechanism is core to achieving modularity and reusability in v1.9.

### 5.1 Syntax and Behavior

- `imports` field is a string array.
- **Path Resolution**: Paths are relative to the directory where the current `agent.yaml` file is located (i.e., `${AGENT_HOME}`).
- **Content Requirements**: Imported YAML files must be objects containing a `tools` list.

**Example: Imported file (`modules/file_ops.yaml`)**

```yaml
# Shareable file operation toolset
tools:
  - name: read_file
    exec: "cat ${path}"
  - name: write_file
    exec: "tee ${path}"
    stdin: content
```

### 5.2 Merging Logic

The engine executes the following merging logic when loading configurations:

1. **Parse `imports`**: Read and parse all imported files in order (supports recursive imports, but requires circular dependency detection).
2. **Merge**: Merge all imported `tools` lists with the `tools` list locally defined in `agent.yaml`.
   - **Merge Order**: tools from `imports[0]` + tools from `imports[1]` + ... + locally defined tools.
3. **Conflict Resolution (Last Write Wins)**: If tools with the same name appear, later-loaded definitions override earlier ones. This means **locally defined tools have the highest priority**, allowing users to override default implementations in imported modules.

### 5.3 Security Boundaries

To ensure system security, the `imports` mechanism must follow strict path restrictions:

- **Prohibit Path Traversal**: Import paths must not contain `../` or other attempts to access parent directories.
- **Root Directory Restriction**: Resolved absolute paths must strictly reside within the Agent project directory (`${AGENT_HOME}`). The engine must validate this to prevent arbitrary file reading.

## 6. Implementation Architecture

### 6.1 Configuration Loader Workflow

The engine's configuration loading module needs upgrading to support the new file structure and mechanism.

**Loading Process:**

1. **Locate Main Config**: Engine first looks for `${AGENT_HOME}/agent.yaml`. Performs compatibility check (looks for `config.yaml`, see Section 7).
2. **Parse and Import (`imports`)**:
   - Parse main configuration file contents.
   - If `imports` field exists, perform path security validation (Section 5.3), recursively load files, and execute tool merging logic (Section 5.2).
3. **Load `hooks.yaml` (convention loading)**:
   - Check if `${AGENT_HOME}/hooks.yaml` exists and load it.
   - **Note**: Handle compatibility logic with legacy `lifecycle_hooks` field (see Section 7 for details).
4. **Load `context.yaml` (convention loading)**:
   - Check if `${AGENT_HOME}/context.yaml` exists. If it exists, use it to configure Context Builder; otherwise, use default strategy.

## 7. Migration Path and Compatibility

We adopt a "compatible and inclusive, gradual deprecation" strategy to provide a smooth migration path.

### 7.1 Phase One: Compatibility Period (v1.9)

In v1.9, implement the following compatibility strategies:

1. **Filename Compatibility**:
   - Engine prioritizes `agent.yaml`. If not found, falls back to `config.yaml`.
   - If `config.yaml` is loaded, print clear `[DEPRECATION WARNING]`, prompting users to rename.
   - If both exist, `agent.yaml` takes priority and a warning is printed.

2. **`hooks` Compatibility**:
   - Engine prioritizes loading hooks from `hooks.yaml`.
   - If `hooks.yaml` doesn't exist but the main config file contains `lifecycle_hooks` field, load from it and print `[DEPRECATION WARNING]` prompting user to migrate to `hooks.yaml`.

3. **Tool Updates**:
   - `delta init` command updated to generate `agent.yaml` structure by default.
   - All documentation and examples comprehensively updated to v1.9 specification.

### 7.2 Phase Two: Remove Compatibility (v2.0)

With the next major version (v2.0) release:

1. Formally remove support for `config.yaml`.
2. Formally remove support for loading `lifecycle_hooks` from `agent.yaml` (only support `hooks.yaml`).

## 8. Conclusion

The v1.9 architecture refactoring is another profound practice of our core philosophy of "engineering effective and simple." By introducing `agent.yaml`, achieving separation of concerns (`hooks.yaml`), and providing powerful composition capabilities through the `imports` mechanism, we achieve a unified architecture that is **extremely simple in intuitiveness, highly flexible in engineering, and logically self-consistent in philosophy**.

This new architectural paradigm will greatly improve developer efficiency, reduce cognitive load, and lay a solid foundation for the future ecosystem evolution of Delta Engine.

## 9. Addendum: context.yaml Status Upgrade (v1.9.1)

**Version**: 1.9.1
**Date**: October 13, 2025
**Type**: Breaking Change - Architecture Refinement

### 9.1 Design Decision Update

In v1.9.0, `context.yaml` was designed as **optional** with fallback to a hardcoded `DEFAULT_MANIFEST` when the file was missing. This design was intended to support "progressive disclosure" by allowing beginners to start without understanding context composition.

After deep architectural review, we recognized a fundamental conflict: **this "implicit convention" contradicts Delta Engine's core philosophy of "Explicit over Implicit"**. A hidden default configuration is, by its nature, a form of "magic" that we are committed to eliminating.

**Core Change**: `context.yaml` is now **REQUIRED** (upgraded from optional to mandatory).

### 9.2 Philosophical Rationale

This upgrade represents a re-affirmation and strict adherence to Delta Engine's core philosophy:

#### 9.2.1 From "Implicit Convention" to "Physical Contract"

Delta Engine positions itself as a "scientific instrument" requiring all behaviors to be observable and predictable. We elevate context construction strategy from a **"hidden convention"** buried in engine internals to a **"physical contract"** that is clearly visible in the project after initialization.

This makes `context.yaml` the **sole, complete, and explicit recipe** for constructing the LLM's attention window.

#### 9.2.2 Complete Agent Definition: The Trinity

This change ensures the Agent definition achieves true self-containment and completeness through three core physical contracts:

1. **`agent.yaml` (Capability)**: What the Agent can do.
2. **`system_prompt.md` (Instruction)**: How the Agent should behave.
3. **`context.yaml` (Cognitive Strategy)**: How the Agent perceives the world.

#### 9.2.3 Recalibrating "Progressive Disclosure"

We refine the definition of "progressive disclosure": We should **immediately disclose the existence of mechanisms** (through files) while allowing users to **progressively increase strategy complexity** (through modifying file contents).

The default `context.yaml` template (see 9.4) embodies this principle—it is visible immediately but starts simple and well-documented.

#### 9.2.4 Engineering Simplicity: Single Code Path

The "engineering simplicity" we pursue manifests in code robustness and maintainability. By mandating `context.yaml` existence, we eliminate a critical code branch (checking file existence and falling back to defaults). This achieves **normalization of context-building logic** (single code path), improving system predictability and stability.

### 9.3 Implementation Changes

**Removed Components**:
- Deleted `DEFAULT_MANIFEST` constant from `src/context/types.ts` (lines 137-157)
- Removed fallback logic in `src/context/builder.ts:loadManifest()` (lines 102-104)

**Updated Components**:
- Enhanced error message when `context.yaml` is missing (provides complete fix instructions)
- Updated all 4 built-in templates (`src/templates/index.ts`) to generate `context.yaml` by default
- Updated all 7 examples to include `context.yaml`

**Updated Project Structure** (Section 3.1 revision):
```
/path/to/MyAgent/
├── agent.yaml          # [Required] Core definition
├── system_prompt.md    # [Required] Core instructions
├── context.yaml        # [Required] Cognitive strategy (v1.9.1+)

# --- Optional advanced configuration ---
├── hooks.yaml          # [Optional] Lifecycle hooks

# --- Resources and modules ---
├── tools/              # (Optional) Private tool scripts
└── modules/            # (Optional) Importable modules
```

### 9.4 Default context.yaml Template

All agents initialized via `delta init` will receive this well-documented default template:

```yaml
# Delta Engine Context Strategy (v1.6+)
# This file defines HOW the Agent's attention window (LLM context) is constructed.
# It is the explicit "recipe" for what the Agent sees.

sources:
  # 1. Core Instructions (The System Prompt)
  # This is the primary definition of the Agent's role, rules, and goals.
  # Note: System Prompt must be explicitly declared here to ensure recipe completeness.
  - type: file
    id: system_prompt
    path: '${AGENT_HOME}/system_prompt.md'

  # 2. Workspace Guide (Optional: DELTA.md)
  # If a DELTA.md file exists in the workspace (CWD), it is automatically loaded.
  # Use this to provide workspace-specific context, rules, or documentation.
  - type: file
    id: workspace_guide
    path: '${CWD}/DELTA.md'
    on_missing: skip  # Skip if DELTA.md does not exist

  # 3. Conversation History (The Journal)
  # Includes the history of Thoughts, Actions, and Observations.
  - type: journal
    id: conversation_history
    # By default, the full history is included.
    # To limit history length (save tokens or manage attention), uncomment and adjust:
    # max_iterations: 20
```

**Design Principle**: The default template serves dual purposes:
1. **Immediate functionality**: Replicates the previous default behavior exactly
2. **Educational value**: Clear comments explain each component and provide customization hints

### 9.5 Migration Path for Existing Agents

**Impact**: Breaking change—agents without `context.yaml` will fail to start.

**Quick Migration**: Create `context.yaml` in the agent's root directory with the default template content shown in 9.4. This exactly replicates the previous implicit default behavior.

**Error Message**: When `context.yaml` is missing, the engine provides:
- Clear explanation of the requirement
- Complete default template content for copy-paste
- Link to this documentation section

**Example error output**:
```
Error: context.yaml not found in /path/to/agent

Delta Engine requires an explicit context.yaml file to define how
the agent's attention window is constructed.

Quick fix - Create context.yaml with default content:

sources:
  - type: file
    id: system_prompt
    path: '${AGENT_HOME}/system_prompt.md'
  - type: file
    id: workspace_guide
    path: '${CWD}/DELTA.md'
    on_missing: skip
  - type: journal
    id: conversation_history

docs/architecture/v1.9-unified-agent-structure.md#9-addendum-contextyaml-status-upgrade-v191
```

### 9.6 Compatibility and Transition Strategy

**No Compatibility Period**: Given the early stage of adoption and minimal user base, we implement this change immediately without transition period or migration tools.

**Documentation References**:
- Migration mentioned in CLAUDE.md (updated project structure)
- Examples updated to demonstrate best practices

### 9.7 Benefits Summary

This architectural refinement delivers improvements across multiple dimensions:

1. **Philosophical Consistency**: Eliminates the last "implicit magic" in core system
2. **Transparency**: Complete visibility into context construction strategy
3. **Engineering Robustness**: Single code path, reduced complexity
4. **User Empowerment**: Configuration-as-documentation approach
5. **Discoverability**: Native features (DELTA.md support) are now explicit

This change strengthens Delta Engine's positioning as a "scientific instrument" with predictable, observable, and fully explicit behavior.
