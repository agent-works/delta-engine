## Project Mission

Delta Engine is not just another AI framework—it's a **scientific instrument** for expert-level AI researchers. Its mission is to fundamentally accelerate the research, testing, and iteration cycles of AI agent prototypes through radical simplicity and transparency.

Success is measured not by the final performance of agents, but by how much it improves researchers' experimental efficiency and innovation velocity.

## The Three Pillars

### 1. Everything is a Command

**Philosophy**: The engine has no built-in tools. All capabilities are external command-line programs.

**Why it matters**:
- Universal, time-tested interaction paradigm
- Language-agnostic extensibility (Python, Rust, Bash, anything)
- Complete decoupling of capabilities from engine core
- Tool development = writing any CLI program

**Example**:
```yaml
tools:
  - name: run_sub_agent
    shell: "delta run --agent ${agent_path} --task ${task}"
```

### 2. The Environment is the Interface

**Philosophy**: Agents interact with the world solely through the Current Working Directory (CWD).

**Why it matters**:
- The file system becomes the universal API contract
- Agents read state from files, write state to files
- No complex in-memory objects or API calls
- Natural "zero-copy" agent collaboration through shared directories

**Key Design**: CWD is divided into two planes:
- **Data Plane**: Agent's workspace (task artifacts)
- **Control Plane**: `.delta/` - Engine's audit log (invisible to agent)

```
/workspace/
├── data.csv          # Data Plane (agent's work)
├── report.md         # Data Plane (agent's work)
└── .delta/           # Control Plane (engine's audit log)
    └── {run_id}/
        ├── journal.jsonl
        └── io/
```

### 3. Composition Defines Intelligence

**Philosophy**: Complexity emerges from composing simple agents, not from a bloated central engine.

**Why it matters**:
- System intelligence = LEGO-style agent composition
- "Composition over built-in" guides all feature development
- Each agent is a self-contained, version-controllable project
- Sub-agent orchestration is a first-class concept

**Example**: Parent agent creates a subdirectory, launches sub-agent there, gets results back—all through the file system.

## Market Positioning

Delta Engine occupies a unique niche distinct from mainstream frameworks:

| Dimension | Delta Engine | LangGraph | AutoGen | CrewAI |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Philosophy** | Composition, minimalism, Unix | Chain-based control flow | Conversation-driven | Role-playing |
| **Abstraction** | Command, Agent (Process) | Graph, Node, State | ConversableAgent | Role, Task |
| **Orchestration** | Decoupled OS processes | Stateful graph (Python) | Message-passing | Sequential/parallel tasks |
| **State** | File system (CWD) | In-memory objects | Chat history | Task outputs |
| **Target** | Expert developers | Complex workflow builders | Human-collab simulators | Rapid role-based dev |

**Position**: "The Linux/Git of AI agents"—providing powerful, reliable infrastructure for builders who value control and transparency.

## Key Design Decisions

### Stateless Core
- Engine retains no state between iterations
- All context rebuilt from `journal.jsonl` on each cycle
- Perfect resumability and reproducibility

### Immutable Ledger
- Every thought, action, observation logged chronologically
- Transforms opaque AI reasoning into auditable event stream
- Debugging becomes rigorous engineering, not arcane art

### Lifecycle Hooks
- External commands intervene at critical junctures (e.g., before LLM call)
- Implement advanced behaviors without modifying engine core
- Context engineering, memory retrieval, observation filtering—all composable

## Intentional Trade-offs

### What Delta Engine Optimizes For
- ✅ Transparency and auditability
- ✅ Reproducibility and debuggability
- ✅ Language-agnostic tool ecosystem
- ✅ Expert user control and flexibility

### What Delta Engine Does NOT Optimize For
- ❌ High-frequency, low-latency streaming interactions
- ❌ No-code/low-code business user experience
- ❌ Out-of-the-box security sandboxing (user's responsibility)

## Why Node.js Core? (Strategic Choice)

In a Python-dominated AI field, Delta Engine chose Node.js/TypeScript:

1. **Superior DX**: NPM provides one-click, cross-platform installation
2. **Philosophy Reinforcement**: Building in Node.js while supporting Python tools exemplifies "language-agnostic" architecture
3. **Future-Proof**: Unified JavaScript/TypeScript stack for backend + frontend (APIs, UIs, visualizations)
4. **Distribution Vision**: Agents as NPM packages (versioning, dependency management)

## Evolution Strategy

**Layered Development** (Composition over Built-in):
- **Layer 1 (Core)**: Keep minimalist, resist complexity temptation
- **Layer 2 (Composition)**: Agent packaging, distribution (NPM ecosystem)
- **Layer 3 (User Space)**: Optional plugins—security sandboxes, monitoring dashboards, visual debuggers

This ensures Delta Engine can address real-world complexity without sacrificing philosophical purity.
