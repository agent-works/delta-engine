# Delta Engine Context Strategy (v1.6+)
# This file defines HOW the Agent's attention window (LLM context) is constructed.
# It is the explicit "recipe" for what the Agent sees.

sources:
  # 1. Core Instructions (The System Prompt)
  # This is the primary definition of the Agent's role, rules, and goals.
  # Note: System Prompt must be explicitly declared here to ensure recipe completeness.

    path: '${AGENT_HOME}/system_prompt.md'

  # 2. Workspace Guide (Optional: DELTA.md)
  # If a DELTA.md file exists in the workspace (CWD), it is automatically loaded.
  # Use this to provide workspace-specific context, rules, or documentation.
  - type: file
    id: workspace_guide
    path: '${CWD}/DELTA.md'
    on_missing: skip  # Skip if DELTA.md does not exist

  # 3. Conversation History (The Journal)
  # Includes the history of Thoughts, Actions, and Observations.
  - type: journal
    id: conversation_history
    # By default, the full history is included.
    # To limit history length (save tokens or manage attention), uncomment and adjust:
    # max_iterations: 20
