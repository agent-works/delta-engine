# Delta Engine

> A minimalist AI Agent execution engine based on Unix philosophy

## Project Overview

Delta Engine is an efficient and flexible experimental platform built for internal meta-prompting and AI Agent prototype research teams. Its core mission is to **fundamentally accelerate the development, testing, and iteration cycle of AI Agent prototypes**.

## Core Features

- **Everything is a Command**: All capabilities are implemented through executing external command-line programs, providing infinite extensibility
- **The Environment is the Interface**: Unified management of Agent data boundaries and interaction context through the working directory (CWD)
- **Composition Defines Intelligence**: Build complex systems through composing simple atomic Agents, not bloated central engines
- **Language Agnostic**: Process and file system based architecture supports Agents written in any programming language
- **Zero-Copy Orchestration**: Efficient inter-Agent collaboration through shared working directories

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g delta-engine
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run an Agent
delta-engine run --agent ./MyAgent --task "Analyze data files" --work-dir ./work

# Use default working directory
delta-engine run --agent ./MyAgent --task "Search for relevant information"
```

## Agent Project Structure

Each Agent is an independent project directory:

```
MyAgent/
├── config.yaml          # Agent configuration file
├── system_prompt.txt    # System prompt
└── tools/              # Custom tool scripts (optional)
```

## Working Directory

Each run operates in an independent working directory:

```
work_dir/
├── trace.jsonl         # Execution trace log
├── metadata.json       # Run metadata
└── ...                # Other files generated by the Agent
```

## Technology Stack

- **Node.js + TypeScript**: Core engine
- **NPM Ecosystem**: Agent package management and distribution
- **Command Line Interface**: Minimalist interaction

## Target Users

This project is designed for expert-level researchers with advanced AI knowledge who:
- Master prompt engineering and Agent architecture
- Pursue extremely flexible and transparent development experience
- Value complete control over the system
