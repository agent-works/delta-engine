# Delta Engine

> A minimalist platform for AI Agent development - Everything is a Command, The Environment is the Interface

## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ **Simple** - Unix philosophy applied to AI agents
- ðŸ”§ **Transparent** - Complete execution visibility via journal
- ðŸ”Œ **Extensible** - Lifecycle hooks for customization
- ðŸ“¦ **Portable** - Single directory contains everything
- ðŸ”„ **Stateless** - Resumable from any interruption
- ðŸ‘¥ **Interactive** - Human-in-the-loop support for user input (v1.2)


## Core Concepts

### Everything is a Command
All agent capabilities are implemented through external commands - no built-in functions, just Unix tools.

### Environment as Interface
Agents interact with the world through their working directory (CWD) - files are the universal interface.

### Stateless Core
No in-memory state - everything is persisted to disk immediately, enabling perfect resumability.


## Quick Start

```bash
npm install delta-engine -g

# Run the hello-world example
delta run --agent examples/hello-world --task "Create a greeting file"
```


## Agent Structure

```
my-agent/
â”œâ”€â”€ config.yaml         # Agent configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ system_prompt.md    # System prompt (supports .txt)
â””â”€â”€ work_runs/         # Execution workspaces
    â””â”€â”€ workspace_*/
        â””â”€â”€ .delta/    # Control plane (logs, I/O)
```
